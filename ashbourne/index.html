  A thriving picturesque market town on the edge of The Peak District, rich in history, Ashbourne is the perfect destination for couples, families and groups.

Combining a medieval street pattern and historic buildings with a wealth of high quality shops. The cobbled market place, hidden alleys and yards are a delight to explore, and the wide and elegant Church Street is considered to be the finest street of Georgian buildings in Derbyshire.

Our town hosts a wide range of restaurants, tearooms and family friendly pubs and there is something for every budget and taste.

Ashbourne is surrounded by beautiful countryside and is an ideal base for a short break or longer holiday. If you enjoy stately homes, you are in for a treat with Chatsworth, Sudbury Hall, Hardwick Hall, Kedleston Hall, Tissington Hall just to name a few within easy drive from Ashbourne.
